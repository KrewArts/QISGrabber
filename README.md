# QISGrabber
A small script to grab marks from the QIS/HIS server. Only works with HfTL students.

Make sure you installed the "requests" module. (http://www.python-requests.org/en/latest/)
This program is written in in python 2.7.10, so there is no support for python 3.x as of right now.

Usage is pretty simple. Navigate to the file via terminal/cmd and just run the script.
It'll ask you for your username and password and if they are right you will get a list of your marks and a statistic with passed and failed exams. 

This programm is in alpha status right now, so it'll change.
